# Reflectia

Reflectia is a user-friendly social media application built using React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. The primary objective of Reflectia is to provide a platform where users can capture and share their cherished memories in the form of photos and videos. The application fosters interaction between users by allowing them to like and engage with each other's posts. Additionally, Reflectia provides easy content management features to empower users with control over their shared content.

## Features

- **Like and Interaction**: Reflectia encourages social interaction by enabling users to like and interact with posts from other users.

- **Content Management**: Users have the freedom to manage their posted content, edit their posts, or even delete them when desired.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js and Express form the backbone of Reflectia's server-side architecture, handling requests and data processing.

- **Database**: Reflectia utilizes MongoDB, a powerful NoSQL database, to efficiently store and retrieve user information, posts, and interactions.
